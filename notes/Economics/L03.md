Utility

U = U(x), where x is the amount of good x. 
U(x) can take many forms such as $x, x^2, \ln(x)$ etc.

Marginal utility
Additional utility of one additional unit of the good. 
$$
u = u(x)\\
Mu_x = \frac{du}{dx} = U'(x)
$$

Multiple goods
$$
U = U(x,y)\\
Mu_x = \frac{ \delta u}{ \delta x}, Mu_y = \frac{ \delta u}{ \delta y}
$$

Plotting $U(x,y)$.

Let $U_0 = U(x_0,y_0)$.
The indifference curve is the locus of $(x,y)$ which gives the same level of utility. (looks somewhat like $\frac{1}{x}$)

Note that $U(x_0+ \delta_x, y_0+ \delta_y)$ will give either more utility, less utility,
or same amount of utility.

Indifference curve

Properties:
1. Negatively sloped.
2. Further an IC from the origin, higher is the level of utility.
3. ICs cannot intersect. 

The slope of IC is called the marginal rate of substitution

Substitute goods.
tea, coffee

complementary goods.
tea, sugar, milk

Degree of substitutivity
Perfect complements <---> Perfect substitutes.

IC of Perfect substitues is a straight line, with negatively slope. The slope can vary.  
What will be the IC of perfect complements?
