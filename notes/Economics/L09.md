### Sales tax

Price: $y$ 

Sales tax rate: $t$

The good is then sold for $y+ty$



Price: $y +ty$

tax rate: $t$

Sold for: $(y+ty)+t\cdot (y+ty)$

And so on for the subsequent sales. 



This creates a tax cascading effect. Not desirable. Increases artifically the price of inputs used in production. Thus sales tax was abandoned and moved to a system of value added tax (VAT)

### Value added tax

$y-x$

Output, input

Then,
$$
\text{VAT} = t(y-x) \\=ty-tx
$$
Example. Say you purchase input for $100$, with a tax $10\%$. Thus Rs $100+10$ is paid for the input. When you sell this good, the tax rate is again $10\%$, applied on Rs $110$. The buyer pays $110+110\cdot10\%$ which is Rs $121$. The tax you will pay to the goverment is $11-10$. The $10$ Rs deducted is called ITC (input tax credit). This ensures that there is no tax cascading. The producer does not pay tax on inputs. 


$$
A\xrightarrow[10%]{100}B\xrightarrow[10%]{110+20}C:\;{143}
$$

B adds 20 rupees value.

$$
A\xrightarrow[10\%]{100(v)}B\xrightarrow[10\%]{100(v)+10(t)}C:120
$$
Thus,

- No tax on inputs
- No tax cascading

However, disadvantages,

- Requires detailed bookkeeping by both A and B
-
