Consumer behavior.

Preference and Utility. 

## Axioms to define rational behavior.

### Preference: 
> If an individual prefers A to B, then they are better off with A than B.

Properties of preference:
1. Completeness: if there are two options A and B, an individual 
	1. Prefers A to B
	2. Prefers B to A
	3. Is indifferent to A and B
	This property rules out indecision. 

2. Transitivity: if A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C, then A is preferred to C.
This property rules out inconsistency. 

3. Continuity: if A is preferred to B, and if C is close to A, then C is preferred to B. 
Rules out discontinuity or jumps and knife-edge situations in preference. 

### Utility:
> The level of satisfaction from consumption of a good. 

If $U(A) > U(B)$ iff A is preferred to B.

Utility is ordinal. _i.e._ the value doesn't matter, just the order. 
Thus, U(A)=30, U(B) = 40 is the same as U(A) = 0.03, U(B) = 40000.
